The main idea of this project follows a parsing the file of json which has a statistical information about users like: visiting internet resource, ip-address, user name and so on. For realization this idea I was using the following stack of technologies namely: java core, spring boot, spring data, mysql. This project also has opportunity to filter of information by different fields and to show number of visits on the graph. In order to have a possibility to see how it works you need to activate an accesses to proxy server by this link: https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo. The working version of this project is here: https://bitlabs-73416.firebaseapp.com
